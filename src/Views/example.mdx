Ready to pen a love note to the blockchain, or an everlasting secret message to your friend (or your future self)? Dreamed of sending a digital "message in a bottle" that can never get washed away? Well this tutorial will have you writing on the blockchain faster than a caffeine-fueled coder on a deadline! In this bite-sized tutorial, you'll learn how to tuck a nifty message - "Hello CKB!" - into a cell on the CKB testnet. Imagine it as sending a message in a bottle, but the ocean is digital, and the bottle is a super secure, tamper-proof CKB cell! Once your words are encrypted and inscribed into the blockchain, we'll show you how to uncover them on the CKB explorer.
