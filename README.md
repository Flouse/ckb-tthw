# Time to `Hello World` on CKB

The target of this tutorial is very simple: use CKB SDKs in various languages to write "Hello Common Knowledge Base!" into a cell on CKB testnet and check it on CKB explorer.

## Sample Code
After installing Lumos, you can use it to send a transaction to CKB testnet, write a simple `Common Knowledge`: "Hello World" into a [cell](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/cell/) on CKB.
Here's an example of how you can do that:

## TODO
- [ ] implement interactive tutorial experiences
  In this tutorial, a browser-based runtime called [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/) is leveraged to create a minimal development environment only in the browser to acheive interactive tutorial experiences. Let's use the latest web capabilities to deliver a nice browser-based development experience for a new generation of interactive courses.
